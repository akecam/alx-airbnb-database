## AIRBNB Database

# Design

This repository holds the schemas and scripts to create the structure of our database in Mysql.


# ERD

`ERD/` Entity Relationship Diagram contains the visual representation of all the Entities and their Attributes.
   * `requirements.md`: contains the documentation of the Attributes and Entities needed for our AirBnB App. It also contains the constraints added such as `PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`, etc, and the relationships established
    * `visual_relationship.png`: The visual representation of the File/Entities and their Attributes

# database-script-0x01

`database-script-0x01` contains the Data Definition Language (such as `CREATE`) that was used in defining the structure of the database schema. It includes the definition of the `user` table, `booking` table, etc, using a SQL (structured Query Language) script.
  * `schema.sql`: The sql script that contains all the `DDL` needed for the AirBnB app. It has been tested on `MySQL` and `MariaDB` and runs without an error.
